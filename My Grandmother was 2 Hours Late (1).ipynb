With her mother and sister in toe, they made the trek to be united with their father in The States. \n\nUpon arrival, they were dissapointed learn that their vessel of freedom had left without them, a mere two hours before. \nI can only image their relief when they learned of their good fortune to nearly miss the most famous ship distaster in history.\n\nI had always heard this story by family members, but much to my suprise, elements of this story actually exist in her obitutary.
